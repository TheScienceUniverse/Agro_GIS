## Problem
**Statement:**
_`Determination of Different Varieties of agricultural and commercial crops grown in states in India
over the years and their annual production output from the year 2003-2014.`_

**Meaning:**
Agriculture is the primary occupation in India even today after so many years of industrialization. 
Food grains are one of the major produces of agriculture which includes cereals like rice, rabi,
jowar, bajra, maize etc. Every year the annual production of the cereals increases. Each state in
India grows a certain type of food grain. For example, Wheat cultivation is largely favoured in North
Western regions like Punjab, Haryana whereas rice is cultivated mostly in the Eastern regions like
West Bengal, Orissa and Assam.

Our task will be to show variation of different crops grown over the years on the basis of different
states in India. We will try to display the crops grown in different states in India, over the
varieties of crops grown in the time duration between 2003 and 2014.
